## Created With
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Moment.js
* HTML
* CSS

### This project focused on jQuery and dynamic HTML/CSS 
Given a foundation of HTML and CSS, the ```.js``` file was created on my own!

As a student with a busy schedule and a full-time job, this application will prove to be very useful! I wanted to flex my jQuery muscles a bit more and become more confident writing ```.js``` on my own. My priority is always functionality, but I wanted to have fun with this project and make it visually pleasing as well. Feedback and advice to improve my code is always welcome, thanks for looking!
